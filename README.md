This voice assistant is based on python. I have used various different libraries so before using this project, try to explore all the packages and modules. 
This assistant will work to its next level finctionalities if and only if you have the paid subscription of OpenAI ( ChatGPT ). 
This subscription will get you an API Key that you will use in this project. Please do not share your API Keys with anyone as it may get expired.
I have not mentioned my API Key and I have also comment out the codes that particularly make use of OpenAI.
If you do have the subscription, feel free to uncomment the codes and follow the instructions that I have written in the comments in front of them.
Even if you do not have the subscription, the assistant is still very much funcitoning as it can play news, songs and even open websites at your commands. 
Please make sure you understand the code and more importantly the logic before you use this Project.
